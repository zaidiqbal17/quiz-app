# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


# Quiz App

A simple Quiz Application built using **React**. It fetches quiz questions from an API, shows them to the user, and tracks answers with a timer.

---

## üìñ Overview
This app is made to test users with multiple-choice questions. It has a clean design, a timer to limit the quiz, and reusable components to keep the code simple and organized.  
I built this project to practice **React hooks, API calls, reusable components, and TailwindCSS**.

---

## üõ† My Approach
- Planned the structure (questions, options, timer, buttons).
- Built **reusable components** like Button, InputField, QuestionDisplay.
- Created a **custom hook (useQuizData)** for fetching quiz questions.
- Added a **Timer** component to control quiz duration.
- Styled everything using **TailwindCSS**.

---

## üß© Components I Built
- **Button** ‚Üí Reusable button with different variants (primary, secondary, danger).  
- **InputField** ‚Üí Input field with label and required validation.  
- **QuestionDisplay** ‚Üí Shows question and multiple-choice options.  
- **Timer** ‚Üí Countdown timer for quiz duration.  
- **useQuizData (Custom Hook)** ‚Üí Handles quiz question fetching and API state.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zaidiqbal17/quiz-app.git

   cd quiz-app

   npm install

   npm run dev
   

## Challenges Faced & Solutions
Timer going below zero ‚Üí Solved by using Math.max in the Timer component.

State update after unmount ‚Üí Added an isMounted flag in useQuizData.

Dynamic button styling ‚Üí Used conditional class names to highlight selected options.
